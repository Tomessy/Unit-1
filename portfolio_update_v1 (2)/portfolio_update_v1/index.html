          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I have always enjoyed working on things and seeing the end result and what I built. From sandcastles to pitching tents. I took a course in High school that you made code and then it told this little robot that you built how to behave. I really loved that.</p>
          <p>Currently I am going to college at South East Missouri State University to do a dual major in Computer Science and Cyber Security. I decided to take a course in Web development because I want to be more rounded as far as what I know. I really enjoy it now. I can make code and I can see what it does and changes and build things. That is awesome.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>My short term goals are to learn more in depth about the following:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I’d like to learn these more in depth and work as a front-end web developer though college. This would allow me to quite my current job at dominos and work more when I want and it would work better around homework and college as a whole. I am also interested in making this into a career depending on how I enjoy it.</p>
