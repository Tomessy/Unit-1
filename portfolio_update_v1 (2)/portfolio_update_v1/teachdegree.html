          <h3>They teach all levels of experience</h3>
          <p>Before starting with Team Tree House I took about half a class in web development I really enjoyed it. I liked how you learn one of the main languages of the internet HTML. This inspired me to learn more about web development and I looked up how to learn more about it and I discovered Team Tree House kept coming up in videos and blogs. I started the 7 day trial and really liked it.</p>

        <section class="card">
          <h3>Very involved</h3>
          <p>After the free trial I had looked up jobs and knew what I was wanting to learn and how to get there. So I signed up for the teachdegree program. It is pricy coming in at $200 a month. But, you learn a lot. I really like the fact that you can build your portfolio and have a community that supports you. I think this is a lot better then a very much more expensive "bootcamp" I really enjoy the feedback on how the coding looks and ways to improve. </p>
